## About The Project

**Network-Monitor** is an educational platform designed to demystify fundamental concepts of computer networking. Aimed at students and enthusiasts, this project utilizes interactive visualizations and real-time simulations to transform complex topics into practical, easy-to-understand knowledge.

-----

## üöÄ Key Features

  - **Interactive Simulations:** Follow step-by-step processes like DNS domain resolution or the establishment of a TCP connection.
  - **Data Visualization:** View charts and dashboards that display data flow, performance metrics, and the status of each network component.
  - **Detailed Explanations:** Each simulation step is accompanied by clear and concise explanations of what is happening behind the scenes.
  - **Feature Comparison:** Understand the differences between various load-balancing algorithms or the benefits of using a CDN.

-----

## üìö Modules Covered

Currently, Network-Monitor covers the following essential topics:

  - **DNS (Domain Name System):** Simulates the process of resolving a domain name to an IP address, showcasing the hierarchy from the local resolver to the root and authoritative servers.
  - **Load Balancer:** Visually demonstrates how different algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections) distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.
  - **TCP Connection:** Explains the famous *Three-Way Handshake* used to establish a connection and the four-way process to terminate it, detailing each flag (SYN, ACK, FIN).
  - **HTTP Request:** Illustrates the complete lifecycle of an HTTP request, from the client's initial query to the server's response, including methods, status codes, and headers.
  - **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Shows how a CDN accelerates content delivery by serving files from edge servers geographically closer to the user.
  - **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Visualizes how a VPN creates a secure, encrypted "tunnel" for your data, protecting your privacy and masking your IP address.
